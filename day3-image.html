        <p>The word bansuri originates in the bans (बाँस) [bamboo] + sur (सुर) [melody].[citation needed] A phonetically similar name for the same instrument, in early medieval texts, is the Sanskrit word vaṃśi which is derived from root vaṃśa (Sanskrit: वंश[12]) meaning bamboo.[11] A flute player in these medieval texts is called vamsika.[13]</p>

        <h2>Bansuri </h2>
        <p>A bansuri is an ancient side-blown bamboo flute originating from the Indian Subcontinent. It is an aerophone produced from bamboo and metal-like material, used in many Indian and Nepali Lok songs. A bansuri is traditionally made from a single hollow shaft of bamboo with seven finger holes. Some modern designs come in ivory, fiberglass and various metals. The six-hole instrument covers two and a half octaves of music. The bansuri is typically between 30 and 75 centimetres (12 and 30 in) in length, and the thickness of a human thumb.[1][2] One end is closed, and few centimeters from the closed end is its blow hole. Longer bansuris feature deeper tones and lower pitches.[1] The traditional design features no mechanical keys, and the musician creates the notes they want by covering and uncovering the various finger holes.[1][3]</p>

        <p>The early medieval Indian bansuri was, however, influential. Its size, style, bindings, mounts on ends and playing style in medieval Europe artworks has led scholars, such as Liane Ehlich, a flute scholar at the music school in the University of Lucerne, to state that the bansuri (venu) migrated from India into the Byzantine Empire by the 10th century and from there on to medieval Europe where it became popular.[20][21]</p>
